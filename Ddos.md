DDoS meaning: What is DDoS?
Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDoS attack involves multiple connected online devices, 
collectively known as a botnet, which are used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic.

Unlike other kinds of cyberattacks, DDoS assaults don’t attempt to breach your security perimeter. Rather, a DDoS attack aims to make your website and 
servers unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS can also be used as a smokescreen for other malicious activities and to take down security appliances, breaching the target’s security perimeter.

A successful distributed denial of service attack is a highly noticeable event impacting an entire online user base. This makes it a popular weapon of choice 
for hacktivists, cyber vandals, extortionists and anyone else looking to make a point or champion a cause.

DDoS attacks can come in short bursts or repeat assaults, but either way the impact on a website or business can last for days, weeks and even months, as the organization tries to recover. This can make DDoS extremely destructive to any online organization. Amongst other things, DDoS attacks can lead to loss of revenues, erode consumer trust, force businesses to spend fortunes in compensations and cause long-term reputation damage.
